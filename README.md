## Project description:

The objective of this project is to identify:

**1. Total Vehicles:** I should understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

**2. Average Electric Range:** I should determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

**3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:** I had to identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset. I Also had to calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

**4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:** Again I should identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset. Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

**5. Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards):** This chart will illustrate the distribution of electric vehicles over the years, starting in 2010, providing insights into the growth pattern and adoption trends.

**6. Total Vehicles by State:** This chart will showcase the geographical distribution of electric vehicles across different states, allowing for the identification of regions with higher adoption rates.

**7. Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make:** Highlight the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers based on the total number of vehicles, providing insights into the market dominance of specific brands.

**8. Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility:** Illustration of the proportion of electric vehicles that are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, aiding in understanding the impact of incentives on vehicle adoption.

**9. Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model:** Highlights the top 10 electric vehicle models based on the total number of vehicles, offering insights into consumer preferences and popular models in the market.
